These exercises are completely optional if you want to practice more interview questions related to Arrays. You can also come back to these once you have finished the course. I recommend you watch the video titled How To Use Leetcode in the Bonus section of the course at the very end to see how you can do these problems and see solutions in any language that you chose.
